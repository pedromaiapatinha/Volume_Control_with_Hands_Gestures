## Overview
The goal of this project was to explore OpenCV and build a script that that can be used to control the computer volume with hand gestures.

Perform volume control action based on hand gesture:
* If hand gesture is pointing up -> Increase the volume 
* If hand gesture is pointing down -> Decrease the volume
